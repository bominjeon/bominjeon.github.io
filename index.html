        <h5> Heading for Critique of the New Yorker </h5>


        <p>A few weeks ago, during a discussion of “Breaking Bad” on Twitter (my part-time volunteer gig), we all started yakking about the phenomenon of “bad fans.” All shows have them. They’re the “Sopranos” buffs who wanted a show made up of nothing but whackings (and who posted eagerly about how they fast-forwarded past anything else). They’re the “Girls” watchers who were aesthetically outraged by Hannah having sex with Josh(ua). They’re the ones who get furious whenever anyone tries to harsh Don Draper’s mellow. If you create a TV show, you’re probably required to say something in response to these viewers along the lines of, “Well, you know, whatever anyone gets out of the show is fine! It’s not my place to say. I’m just glad people are watching.”</p>

        <h6> 2nd heading in text </h6>

        <p>Luckily, I have not created a show. So I will say it: some fans are watching wrong.<span class= "woh"> Because TV is, in its way, a live performance that goes on for years, shows tend to absorb the responses of its viewers.</span>There is also a tendency, in late seasons of ambitious shows, for scripts to refract these tensions more explicitly, sometimes in an effective way, sometimes defensively. On “Lost,” the characters of Hurley and Arzt, and, later on, Frank and Miles, were clear stand-ins for certain types of “Lost” fans. On “The Sopranos,” the parodic horror film “Cleaver” looked a lot like the version of “The Sopranos” that those lousy fast-forwarders wished they were watching. On “Sex and the City,” the “face girl”—the judgmental lady who wouldn’t listen to Carrie’s side of the story—resembled, suspiciously, the fan who wouldn’t listen to Carrie’s side of the story.</p>

        <blockquote>this is some important quote from important person</blockquote>
        
        <p>In my earlier post about this season’s opening episode of “Breaking Bad,” I mentioned that Todd looked very much like the prototypical Bad Fan of “Breaking Bad”: he arrived late in the story, and he saw Walt purely as a kick-ass genius, worthy of worship (like Jesse, he called him Mr. White). Two episodes later, my hunch was confirmed when Todd excitedly re-told the entire Great Train Robbery desert caper to his Nazi uncle, including every single awesome, suspenseful detail but one: that pesky kid he’d shot. Bad Fan recapping in a nutshell! It was a short scene, but one that underlined what we all knew: if you ignore the dead kids, son, you are watching “Breaking Bad” wrong.
