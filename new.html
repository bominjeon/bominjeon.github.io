       <h1> A Critique of the New Yorker</h1>
       <div class="essay">
       <h5> <p> I chose to review the New Yorker &rsquo;s adaptation, or dissimulation, to modern technology through analyzing its iPhone application. I downloaded the New Yorker on my newsstand out of curiosity, wondering how the stubborn design philosophy of the New Yorker transferred to one of the latest source of information exchange, smart phone application.</p> 

       <p> When I opened the application, the first screen that greeted me, not surprisingly, was the well-appreciated illustrated cover of the month with the classic &lsquo; the New Yorker&rsquo; sign in Irvin type on top of the screen. The application captured me with a sense of familiarity. It was easy to navigate through from a story to another story even without reading &ldquo;Dept. of Explanation&rdquo;, which was placed after the cover to explain how to use the application. I was expecting an open layout, where I could see multiple articles on one main page. However, its layout and the simplicity of the pages resembled a lot to the actual magazine than to the online website of the New Yorker. This shows how the New Yorker considers the printed and tangible magazine as its priority and also its core identity.</p>

       <p> It was a deliberate choice for the application to have a beginning and an end in every issue just like the magazine. In order to move from one story to another, the user has to flip through pages by dragging a finger across from the right to left. Also, each story extends with scrolling down. I think the New Yorker really connected the dot between tangibility of its original form, the printed magazine, to the sensation of semi-tangibility that touchscreen gives for applications. It makes sense for the iPhone application to be closer to the original than the online website, where there is no &ldquo;touch&rdquo; involved, is.  Aside from the similar framework, the constant and homogeneous use of color red, black and Irvin type made the application feel like nothing but the same old New Yorker. </p>

       <p> The application does not have a good rating on Apple store. It has two stars out of five, followed by a good amount of &lsquo; this is such a bad application&rsquo; feedback. A lot of the negative reviews are about its technical difficulties, such as failures to download newest issues, which comes from long-term use. I could not relate to the ratings because I am a newbie to the application. However, I have my own dissatisfaction that comes from its graphics choices.</p>

       <p> First of all, all the pages are fixed in size. I found the absence of a zoom-in or zoom-out function to be very limiting. The letters feel a little bit too big and the words look crammed on the narrow screen with tiny margins. Because not many words fit into one page, this lead to a long scroll down to the end of each story. Since most part of the application is congruous to the aesthetic of the magazine, I wish the letters were as reasonably small as it is on the printed version.</p>

       <p> Full-page advertisements in magazines are never pleasant for me, unless they are very well designed, and they were even more appalling to be seen inside the New Yorker on my screen. Nowadays, it is inevitable to run into advertisements on applications and I understand that the New Yorker needs the advertisements in order to sustain itself. However, the flashy, frequent and out-of-context advertisements in between the stories looked really out of place, more than they looked on printed magazines. The advertisements go against the grain of the magazine&rsquo;s design philosophy and interrupt the flow of reading. The advertisements are too carelessly put together to be in between the New Yorker&rsquo;s careful, minimal and classic designs. Also, they feel overpowering because they take up the whole screen, just like the full-screen mode for watching a video. I think, instead of having full pages dedicated to them, it would be better to have the advertisements incorporated more into the stories as smaller banners. The advertisements should have some standard of subtlety to be placed in between mature reading materials. It is never pleasant to be confronted by a commercial when readers are flipping through pages still contemplating on the reading they just finished.</p>  

       <p> I am not completely annoyed by these functions to dislike the application. I actually noticed how deliberately designed everything was. In effort to make the application easier to navigate while providing minimal changes, the application provides a pop-up list of contents with thumbnail images on the bottom right corner. This minimizes the possible annoyance that comes from having to flip through immense amount of pages on the electronic version of magazine. Also the scroll bar on the menu, which also pops up from the bottom with a touch, allows the readers to quickly jump from a page to another.</p> 

       <p> I appreciate the New Yorker&rsquo;s effort not to miss any detail of its unique illustration sensibility by providing a &ldquo;Gallery View&rdquo; button. This button allows readers to zoom in to a full picture of each illustration and also provides a caption with the artists&rsquo; names. I think it is a nice touch to connect with the New Yorker&rsquo;s identity with its beloved illustrations.</p>

       <p> As Michael Beirut mentioned in his article &ldquo;In Praise of Slow Design&rdquo;, the New Yorker has been keeping its tradition in simplicity of graphic design thereby establishing its unique identity. It does not blow things out of proportion in order to emphasize important and shocking news. It sticks to its design tradition whether it is carrying shocking news or not. Just like the magazine, the iPhone application does not display bolder words nor use hierarchy in order to get people&rsquo;s attention to certain article. Compared to other magazines, there is little to no visual cue that indicates the enclosed stories on the cover.</p>

       <p>In this sense, I feel the magazine was made for people, who have patience to sit down, read and truly absorb what is happening in the world. It is not desinged for people who want to pick out information quickly by glimpse of bolder words and highlighted images while passing by newsstands. It is also promoting slow-reading culture along with its slow-design culture.</p></h5>
